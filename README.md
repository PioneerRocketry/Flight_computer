# Flight_computer
Basically, we are simulating the flights in OpenRocket, exporting the altitude data to csv, then writing our program in python to read in the csv data and simulate the
flight computer in air!

So far, it's very basic and can handle very little noise in the data. 

Next steps:
  - modify to handle noise in data
  - write in arduino and feed simulation data to arduino to get better quality simulation
  - automate simulation testing
